Contributing Guide
==================

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the development of pyzuny by creating features, fixing bugs, or just refactoring
the code. However we ask to follow the following guidelines when doing so

Are my changes appropriate for the project?
-------------------------------------------

Before starting to work on a feature or bug fix, it's a good idea to discuss it with the project maintainers. You can
do this by opening an issue on the github repository or by reaching out to the maintainers directly. This will help
ensure that your changes align with the project's goals and that they will be accepted.

How to contribute to the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First create a fork of the github repository, you can do that by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right of the
repository page. Then clone said fork with:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pyznuny.git

After you do your changes in your forked codebase you can now open a pull request by clicking the button
"New pull request" on the repository page.

Commit Messages Guidelines
---------------------------

We ask that you follow the `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_ guidelines when
writing your commit messages. This will help us keep a consistent and clear history of changes. Remember that each
commit is a specific functionality or change, avoid cramming various changes in the same commit

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

When creating the message of your Pull Request, give it a very clear and concise title on what is changing in the
codebase and in the pull request body enter into the specifics like what are the reasons for the change and how
it will affect the codebase.

Code Review Process
-------------------

Now that you have made your pull request, the pyzuny contributors will go through it and review your changes, is
expected that you will address any feedback or comments they may have, and do changes accordingly. Once the code review
is complete and all feedback has been addressed, your pull request will be merged into the main branch if the
changes are deemed appropriate.
